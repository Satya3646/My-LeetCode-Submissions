        We need a dp array and a prefix array.
        The dp[i] will contain the number of total partitions that can be made till 'i'
        prefix[i] is the sum of dp states from 0 to i.
        Adding a new value to the window changes the min and max hence to keep the difference <= k
        Hence we keep a variable j, the min index till which partitions result in diff <= k
        Thus for dp[i] the state update will be dp[i-1] + dp[i-2] + dp[i-3] +..... dp[j].
        Since we cant alway find this sum, we can just use prefix array to reduce complexity by n
        So here three things are happening : 
        1) window shrink when adding new element to keep diff <= k
        2) dp state update as prefix[i-1] - prefix[j]
        3) prefix update prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + dp[i]

                s.erase(s.find(nums[j])), // We need to erase single instance of the element hence get the iterator to the element, if value is given all the instances will be erased,then the window mechanics will break since j is not updates properly hence we need to delete multiple instances one by one only as if the j is being moved slowly to the right.
                j++;
